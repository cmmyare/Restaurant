                    A Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BCadr.

                    at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure
                    Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
                    the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable
                    source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus
                    Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written BC. 
                    This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
